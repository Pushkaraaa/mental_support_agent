The cognitive theories reviewed included the Theory of Mind \n[26], Theory of weak central coherence [27]. Theory of executive \ndysfunctions [13] and Empathizing - Systemizing theory [1].

One of the very ﬁrst observations made \nearly on in the test was the effect of the \n“escape space” upon the behaviour of the \nchildren, particularly the hyperactive and \nseverely autistic ones. Prior to the modiﬁcations, \none such child with complex auditory, tactile \nand proprioceptive issues, was constantly \nremoving herself from the group to sit on the \nﬂoor against a wall with legs stretched in front, \nbanging her head against them. This would \nusually last for about 10 minutes, after which she \nwould sit quietly alone for a few minutes and \nthen rejoin the group. The child was apparently \nescaping the maladjusted sensory stimulation \nof the session at hand and re-calibrating her \ninner sensory mechanism. She ﬁrst removed \nherself from the situation and then provided \nherself with the sensory input required: auditory \nreduction by distancing herself, tactile by \ninﬂicting pain, and proprioceptive through the \nrhythmic movement and physical boundary of \nthe wall.\nOnce an escape space was made available, \nwhere no other activity was conducted, both \nteachers and the researcher expected this \nchild to spend the majority of her time within \nit. At the very beginning, that was the case, \nbut eventually the child used the space less \nand less. It was observed, however that she \nconstantly looked over her shoulder, checking \nto make sure it was still available. She became \nslightly more focused, if anything only because \nof the diminished number of “escapes”. It was \nalmost as if the mere presence of the option to \nescape was sufﬁcient, and her need to escape \ndecreased, now that she was comfortable \nwith the fact that there was constancy in that \nescape opportunity.\nIn the control class, with the absence of a \nformal and partitioned escape space, similar \neffects were not observed. Those children \nwho did need time-out used a cushion in the \ncorner but were constantly either disturbed by \ntheir curious peers, or joined by them. Either \nway, both the individual child’s escape time, \nas well as the session, was disrupted. Although \nthere was a partitioned area in the class, it \nwas arranged for one to one instruction, with \ndistractions and sensory stimulus incongruent \nwith a true ‘escape’.\nAnother apparent positive in ﬂuence observed \nwas the effect of the compartmentalization \nupon the visual distraction of the children. Many \nof the hyper-visual and even hyper-auditory \nchildren would look up, becoming distracted \nfrom their work, if anyone moved around or \nentered the room. Since regaining the attention \nof an autistic child, once distracted, can be \ndifﬁcult, this was a major problem. The design \nmodiﬁcation, however, with its physical and \nvisual compartments, in ﬂuenced this positively. \nIn the new layout, the children were always \nsituated so that visual accessibility would be \nminimized, particularly during their one to one \nsessions where focus was a priority, and, unlike \ngroup sessions, outside interaction was to be \nminimized (ﬁg. 1). When the child heard a sound \nor saw something move in his peripheral vision, \nhe would look up, as before, but in this case be \nunable to see above and around the partitions. \nEventually the child became conditioned not \nto look up. He became more attentive and \nfocused with this decrease in distraction. With \nthe repetition of this exercise he may learn to \ntransfer the sense of focus and associate it with \nthe activity at hand. Hopefully such a skill can \neventually be generalized to other spaces,\n\nCitation: Gopal A, Raghavan J (2018) Design interventions for Sensory comfort of Autistic children.

The four components of such a restorative \nexperience are-fascination (offering processes that people find \nengrossing and attention is effortless leaving ample time for thinking \nabout other things), being away (a conceptual transformation - a change \nin direction of one’s gaze or the same environment viewed in a different \nway), extent (be rich enough with sensory stimuli to engage the mind \nbut not lacking extent) and compatibility (between the demands of the \nenvironment and one’s purposes and inclinations).\nVisual properties for negative emotional states\nAccording to a study, the following visual properties were identified \n[13], which directly affect brain behaviour linked to the negative \nemotional states of anxiety, fear or pain and which have a broader \napplicability for the design field: \na. Valence and arousal\nThe pleasantness-unpleasantness of visual stimuli (valence) and \nsoothing or agitating visual stimuli (arousal) could act as an emotional \nprobe. In the studies conducted by Anders it was found that amygdala \nactivity was involved in the response to valence in visual stimuli and \nthat thalamic and cortical activity increased with arousal. Unpleasant \ncompared with neutral and pleasant visual stimuli can activate the \namygdala and arousal can activate the higher level cortical activity, both \ninducing stress.\nb. Ambiguity\nAmbiguous content in visual stimuli can cause stress, for example, \nuse of abstract art with ambiguity could have a negative effect on \nrestoration by inducing stress. \nc. Familiarity and novelty\nThere is a visual preference for familiar real objects from nature \nover novel patterns. Novelty is associated with a sense of potential threat \naccording to Upali Nanda et.al [13].\nd. Spatial frequency\nSpatial frequency is defined as the frequency of change in \npixel values across an image as a function of distance. High spatial \nfrequencies represent abrupt changes in the image such as edges and \nfine details. Amygdala responses resulting in fear was greater for low \nspatial frequencies of visual stimuli [14].\ne. Contour\nBar and Neta [15] found that amygdala was significantly more active \nfor everyday sharp objects compared with their curved counterparts \nstressing the human preference for curved contours.\nVisual properties for positive emotional states\nAccording to Kaplan and Kaplan, environments that allow a \nshift towards more positive emotional states are called restorative \nenvironments [16]. According to Upali Nanda [13] in psycho \nphysiological studies, a decrease in stress is always linked to restoration \nor healing. As Esther Sternberg suggest in her book ‘Healing Spaces’, \nthe calming influence of nature views could be because repeating \npatterns are pleasing to the eye and the existence of such a self-similar \nsymmetry called fractal geometry could account for the stress reduction \non exposure to nature views. Ary Goldberger, a Professor of Cardiology \nand researcher into heart rate variability, in his paper in 1996, has also \nproposed that fractals are satisfying to the human mind [17].\nIn this context, it is worthwhile to look at the concept of fractal \ngeometry, a geometry underlying nature and natural elements. A fractal \nis a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at \nevery scale. According to B.B.Mandelbrot a vast range of natural objects \nare fractals, including mountains, clouds, rivers and trees [18].  Ranging \nfrom snowflakes to flowing water, fractals are the underlying geometry \nof nature. There are supporting research findings that prove that \nexposure to fractal art could bring about physiological stress relief [18]. \nFractal geometry has been applied in architecture design successfully \nin building geometry [19].

Empathy involves identifying someone else’s \nmental state and having an appropriate emotional reaction to another \nperson’s thoughts and feelings. Systemizing is the drive to analyse \nor construct systems, such that when we systemize we are trying to \nidentify the rules that govern the system in order to predict how that \nsystem will behave.\nNeural theories\na. Neural connectivity abnormalities [28]\nAccording to Belmonte et.al. 2004, abnormal neural connectivity \ncould be the reason for certain motor, cognitive and social difficulties \nin Autism. Accordingly, in Autism, cerebellar activation is abnormally \nlow during a task of selective attention and abnormally high during a \nsimple motor task which correlates significantly with reduced size of \ncerebellar sub regions and resultant connectivity abnormalities.\nb. Malfunctioning based around the amygdala [30]\nSchultz, 2005 in his paper on face perception abnormalities in \nAutism integrated with fMRI literature presents a model of Autism. \nThis model argues that there is an early developmental failure in \nAutism involving the amygdala and development of certain cortical \nareas, specifically the fusiform ‘face area’ of the ventral temporal lobe. \nThe amygdala – fusiform system supports the face recognition and \nsocial cognitive skills and hence deficits in this network is the cause \nfor Autism.\nc. Mirror neuron dysfunction and salience landscape theory \nThere are certain neurons that are part of determining the intentions \nof other individuals by mentally stimulating their actions. These \nneurons called the mirror neurons, typically firing in response to seeing \nsomeone perform an action, are involved in language development and \nempathy. According to V.S.Ramachandran and L.M.Oberman, 2006 \ndysfunctional mirror neuron system could explain some of the primary \nsymptoms of Autism, including isolation and absence of empathy. \nA complimentary hypothesis, the salience landscape theory, could \naccount for secondary symptoms of Autism such as hypersensitivity, \navoidance of eye contact, etc. According to this theory, in children with \nAutism, the connections between the sensory areas and the amygdala \nmay be altered, resulting in extreme emotional responses to trivial \nsensory stimuli.\nAtypical sensory behaviors\nDeficits in the development of sensory abilities might be the original \nproblem underlying social cognition impairments in autism [15] with \nover 90% of Autistic children showing atypical sensory behaviours \n[31]. The sensory processing pattern in any child is dependent on \nthe neurological threshold and behavioral response (passive/ active \nstrategy for responding). According to Frith [32], autistic children \nhave more intense responses in sensory processing patterns and exhibit \nsensory symptoms.\nDesigning for Sensory comfort of Autistic children\nSensory subtypes and possible design interventions\nSensory subtypes of Autistic children\nAccording to Frith [32] there is a relationship between a person’s \nneurological thresholds and self-regulation strategies and that the \ninteraction of these functions creates four basic patterns of sensory \nprocessing. Neurological threshold is the point at which there is \nenough input to cause a nerve cell or a system to activate. When a \nstimulus is strong enough to trigger the threshold, it causes activation \nand we notice it [33]. Each person has a personal range of thresholds \nfor responding to sensory inputs and thresholds might be different \nfor each type of sensory input. Self-regulation corresponds to the \nbehavioural part, whether the person has a passive or active strategy \nfor responding. Passive means they let things happen around them \nand then react and active means they tend to control the amount and \ntype of input that is available to them. When these two continuously \nintersect, 4 basic patterns emerge - low registration, sensation seeking, \nsensory sensitivity and sensation avoiding (Figure 1).\nChildren with Autism have more intense sensory response patterns. \nWhen children have more intense response in low registration, this\n\nCitation: Gopal A, Raghavan J (2018) Design interventions for Sensory comfort of Autistic children.

The neural theories reviewed the theories \nof neural connectivity abnormalities [28], malfunctioning based \naround the amygdala (Schultz, 2005) and mirror neuron dysfunction \n(Ramachandran & Oberman, 2006).\nCognitive theories\nAlthough autism was first explained by Kanner in as early as 1943, \nthe nature of the core deficits underlying this disorder is still vague. \nThere are several theories and hypotheses explaining the persistent \ndeficits in Autistic children. The theories explaining Autism and \nassociated symptoms can be broadly classified into cognitive theories \nand neural theories - the former on the basis of cognitive differences \nand the latter based on neuroanatomical differences.\na. Theory of mind (Baron Cohen, Alan.M.Leslie and Uta Frith 1985)[26]\nIn 1985 ‘Cognition’ published an article by Baron Cohen, \nAlan.M.Leslie and Uta Frith entitled “does the Autistic child have a \ntheory of mind?” [28]. The theory of mind (ToM) hypothesis focussed \non explaining the poor performance of Autistic children on false belief \ntasks, where the participants were required to interpret a situation \nfrom the viewpoint of another, and suggested that the central deficit in \nAutism was the ability to ‘read’ others’ minds in social situations [14] \ncalled this ability ‘mentalizing’. The theory of mind account has been \nremarkably successful in making specific predictions about the triad of \nimpairments shown by people with Autism. However, it cannot explain \nthe non-triad features of Autism or earlier experimental evidence of \nabnormal assets and deficits on non-social tasks [28].\nb. Theory of weak central coherence (UtaFrith, 1989)[27]\nFrith’s formulation of weak coherence (originally called ‘weak \ncentral coherence’) in 1989 was built on the observations of local \nprocessing biases in Autism, combined with the relative failure to extract \nthe gist or meanings of events in everyday life. However in 2006, Happe \nand Frith reformulated the theory in 3 important ways in response to \nother empirical findings:\n(1) It is no longer regarded as a core deficit in central processing \nbut a more secondary outcome characterized by a ‘detail - focussing’ \nprocessing style,\n(2) This processing style can be overcome in certain situations, \n(3) It is one aspect of a more detailed cognitive profile which \nincludes problems with Theory of Mind [1].\nc. Theory of executive dysfunctions \nThe dominant cognitive theory of Autism is the theory of executive \ndysfunctions, executive functions being defined as the ability to \nmaintain an appropriate problem-solving set for attainment of a future \ngoal which includes behaviours such as planning, impulse control, \ninhibition of irrelevant responses, set maintenance, organized search \nand flexibility of thought and action [29]. This theory accounted for \nmany of the non-social symptoms in Autism, such as repetitive and \nobsessional behaviours.\nd. Empathizing - Systemizing theory [1]\nAccording to Baron-Cohen, 2009, the Empathizing - Systemizing \ntheory of Autism explains the social and communication difficulties \nin Autism by reference to delays and difficulties in empathy, while \nLiterature finding Inferences Inferences\nLiterature source Visual properties of built environment Positive change \ninduced Possible design guideline\nBerlyne   [10] adequate visual complexity for inducing a level of arousal.

Temporal changes must be incorporated to the design to \naccommodate the change in perception of the child across time \n(if a child overcomes sensitivity).\nConclusions and Discussions\nDesigning for spaces in which the Autistic child could be sensorily \ncomfortable can potentially help management as many of the symptoms \ncould be manifestations of their sensory discomfort. It could possibly \nreduce parenting stress and can be empirically analyzed through \npre intervention and post intervention survey of caregiver stress. \nThe formulated matrix and design guidelines can help in designing \ncomfortable spaces at homes or at an institutional level. But at the same \ntime, the possibility of the child insisting on the same setting cannot \nbe neglected. As to the possibility of further research along this line, \nthe following may be noted. There are existing research studies that \nconclude that social deprivation influences development of skills that are \nfundamental for early speech and language development [43]. Reduced \nsocial attention will affect a child’s social experience; experience shapes \nbrain connectivity and hence the brain changes observed in older \nchildren and adults with Autism maybe a result of socially deprived \nexperience [44]. Sensory processing differences interferes with social \nparticipation [45], which hinder the ability of autistic children to \nparticipate in social interactions [46]. Hence an attempt to overcome \nthe sensory differences at an early age by desensitization/ exposure to \nspaces designed for sensory discomfort, might help reduce symptoms \nrelated to impairment in social interaction and communication in \nautistic children. There are supporting longitudinal studies proving that \nthe symptom severity in Autism decreases with age [47,48,49] which \ncould possibly be due to slow desensitization over years on exposure to \nreal world situations. And since characterization of the neurobiological \nalterations that underlie Autism and development of novel therapies \nrequire multidisciplinary collaboration [50], cross disciplinary \nresearch studies in future can explore whether specific architectural \ndesign interventions for sensory discomfort can enhance the neural \nconnectivity in cerebellar regions involved in sensory perception and \nintegration and reduce symptom severity in Autistic children.\nFunding support\nThe research work was supported by the Hay grant of Academy \nof Neuroscience for Architecture (ANFA), San Diego, CA.

Empathy involves identifying someone else’s \nmental state and having an appropriate emotional reaction to another \nperson’s thoughts and feelings. Systemizing is the drive to analyse \nor construct systems, such that when we systemize we are trying to \nidentify the rules that govern the system in order to predict how that \nsystem will behave.\nNeural theories\na. Neural connectivity abnormalities [28]\nAccording to Belmonte et.al. 2004, abnormal neural connectivity \ncould be the reason for certain motor, cognitive and social difficulties \nin Autism. Accordingly, in Autism, cerebellar activation is abnormally \nlow during a task of selective attention and abnormally high during a \nsimple motor task which correlates significantly with reduced size of \ncerebellar sub regions and resultant connectivity abnormalities.\nb. Malfunctioning based around the amygdala [30]\nSchultz, 2005 in his paper on face perception abnormalities in \nAutism integrated with fMRI literature presents a model of Autism. \nThis model argues that there is an early developmental failure in \nAutism involving the amygdala and development of certain cortical \nareas, specifically the fusiform ‘face area’ of the ventral temporal lobe. \nThe amygdala – fusiform system supports the face recognition and \nsocial cognitive skills and hence deficits in this network is the cause \nfor Autism.\nc. Mirror neuron dysfunction and salience landscape theory \nThere are certain neurons that are part of determining the intentions \nof other individuals by mentally stimulating their actions. These \nneurons called the mirror neurons, typically firing in response to seeing \nsomeone perform an action, are involved in language development and \nempathy. According to V.S.Ramachandran and L.M.Oberman, 2006 \ndysfunctional mirror neuron system could explain some of the primary \nsymptoms of Autism, including isolation and absence of empathy. \nA complimentary hypothesis, the salience landscape theory, could \naccount for secondary symptoms of Autism such as hypersensitivity, \navoidance of eye contact, etc. According to this theory, in children with \nAutism, the connections between the sensory areas and the amygdala \nmay be altered, resulting in extreme emotional responses to trivial \nsensory stimuli.\nAtypical sensory behaviors\nDeficits in the development of sensory abilities might be the original \nproblem underlying social cognition impairments in autism [15] with \nover 90% of Autistic children showing atypical sensory behaviours \n[31]. The sensory processing pattern in any child is dependent on \nthe neurological threshold and behavioral response (passive/ active \nstrategy for responding). According to Frith [32], autistic children \nhave more intense responses in sensory processing patterns and exhibit \nsensory symptoms.\nDesigning for Sensory comfort of Autistic children\nSensory subtypes and possible design interventions\nSensory subtypes of Autistic children\nAccording to Frith [32] there is a relationship between a person’s \nneurological thresholds and self-regulation strategies and that the \ninteraction of these functions creates four basic patterns of sensory \nprocessing. Neurological threshold is the point at which there is \nenough input to cause a nerve cell or a system to activate. When a \nstimulus is strong enough to trigger the threshold, it causes activation \nand we notice it [33]. Each person has a personal range of thresholds \nfor responding to sensory inputs and thresholds might be different \nfor each type of sensory input. Self-regulation corresponds to the \nbehavioural part, whether the person has a passive or active strategy \nfor responding. Passive means they let things happen around them \nand then react and active means they tend to control the amount and \ntype of input that is available to them. When these two continuously \nintersect, 4 basic patterns emerge - low registration, sensation seeking, \nsensory sensitivity and sensation avoiding (Figure 1).\nChildren with Autism have more intense sensory response patterns. \nWhen children have more intense response in low registration, this\n\nCitation: Gopal A, Raghavan J (2018) Design interventions for Sensory comfort of Autistic children.

The neural theories reviewed the theories \nof neural connectivity abnormalities [28], malfunctioning based \naround the amygdala (Schultz, 2005) and mirror neuron dysfunction \n(Ramachandran & Oberman, 2006).\nCognitive theories\nAlthough autism was first explained by Kanner in as early as 1943, \nthe nature of the core deficits underlying this disorder is still vague. \nThere are several theories and hypotheses explaining the persistent \ndeficits in Autistic children. The theories explaining Autism and \nassociated symptoms can be broadly classified into cognitive theories \nand neural theories - the former on the basis of cognitive differences \nand the latter based on neuroanatomical differences.\na. Theory of mind (Baron Cohen, Alan.M.Leslie and Uta Frith 1985)[26]\nIn 1985 ‘Cognition’ published an article by Baron Cohen, \nAlan.M.Leslie and Uta Frith entitled “does the Autistic child have a \ntheory of mind?” [28]. The theory of mind (ToM) hypothesis focussed \non explaining the poor performance of Autistic children on false belief \ntasks, where the participants were required to interpret a situation \nfrom the viewpoint of another, and suggested that the central deficit in \nAutism was the ability to ‘read’ others’ minds in social situations [14] \ncalled this ability ‘mentalizing’. The theory of mind account has been \nremarkably successful in making specific predictions about the triad of \nimpairments shown by people with Autism. However, it cannot explain \nthe non-triad features of Autism or earlier experimental evidence of \nabnormal assets and deficits on non-social tasks [28].\nb. Theory of weak central coherence (UtaFrith, 1989)[27]\nFrith’s formulation of weak coherence (originally called ‘weak \ncentral coherence’) in 1989 was built on the observations of local \nprocessing biases in Autism, combined with the relative failure to extract \nthe gist or meanings of events in everyday life. However in 2006, Happe \nand Frith reformulated the theory in 3 important ways in response to \nother empirical findings:\n(1) It is no longer regarded as a core deficit in central processing \nbut a more secondary outcome characterized by a ‘detail - focussing’ \nprocessing style,\n(2) This processing style can be overcome in certain situations, \n(3) It is one aspect of a more detailed cognitive profile which \nincludes problems with Theory of Mind [1].\nc. Theory of executive dysfunctions \nThe dominant cognitive theory of Autism is the theory of executive \ndysfunctions, executive functions being defined as the ability to \nmaintain an appropriate problem-solving set for attainment of a future \ngoal which includes behaviours such as planning, impulse control, \ninhibition of irrelevant responses, set maintenance, organized search \nand flexibility of thought and action [29]. This theory accounted for \nmany of the non-social symptoms in Autism, such as repetitive and \nobsessional behaviours.\nd. Empathizing - Systemizing theory [1]\nAccording to Baron-Cohen, 2009, the Empathizing - Systemizing \ntheory of Autism explains the social and communication difficulties \nin Autism by reference to delays and difficulties in empathy, while \nLiterature finding Inferences Inferences\nLiterature source Visual properties of built environment Positive change \ninduced Possible design guideline\nBerlyne   [10] adequate visual complexity for inducing a level of arousal.

Deficit in visual form processing [42]\nAccording to Bogdashina and O Brien, Autistic individuals have a \ndeficit in visual form processing. They used patterns of correlated dot \ntriplets where structured elements were mixed with random ones and \nfound a deficit in visual form processing in Autism [28].\nPossible design interventions (Table 5)\nObservation Studies and Survey of Caregivers - Inferences\nCase studies of ten autistic children done at homes, which included \ndetailed observation study of child as well as questionnaire survey of \ncaregivers, elicited the following inferences - Most of the autistic kids \nexhibit Insistence on Sameness (IS) and the child insisting on the same \nsetting was observed in majority of the cases. Further it was observed \nthat in the case of older kids, most of the sensory sensitivities have been \novercome and the kids have become more manageable which could \npossibly be due to slow desensitization over years on exposure to real \nworld situations.\nDesign Interventions for Sensory Comfort of Autistic \nChildren\nOverlapping the guidelines for psychological comfort, behavioral \nimpact in children, sensory comfort and visual processing differences \nin autistic children, specific guidelines were formulated for modifying \nthe design elements. The design matrix and specific guidelines for \nsensory comfort in autistic children is as follows (Figure 2).\n1. Ensure good general lighting (natural and artificial) for the \nentire space (no flickering lights or dark corners); lighting \ndesign for contrasting shadows of design elements/objects; \nensure means for unobstructed outside view with due \nconsideration to privacy.\n2. Dim indirect artificial lighting and avoid direct sunlight/glare; \nlighting design for sharp contrasting dark corners; provide \noptions to minimize outside view by providing curtains/blinds.\n3. Bright shades of contrasting warm colours are to be used in \ndesign; curve the edges of walls and surfaces; add contrasting \nvisual textures including natural looking surface finishes \n(wood/stone finish), more reflective surfaces (even mirrors), \nfractal patterns and natural elements (pebbles).\n4. Dull shades of contrasting warm colours are to be used \nin design; curve the edges of walls and surfaces; minimize \ncontrasting visual textures and reflective surfaces but include \nfractal patterns and natural elements.\n5. Echo proof through design elements (cloth curtains, \nbookcases); provide for sustained low background sound like \nwater features, wind chimes and so on.\n6. Reduce noise by acoustical treatment.\n7. Provide for prevention of heat gain in the space through \nappropriate design of transparent (double glazing for fixed \nwindows, shading for openable ones) and opaque (false ceiling \nfor heat from roofs) elements.\n8. Provide options for using temperature control systems \n(mechanical systems).\n9. Design for maximum air movement to reduce smells and \nodors.\n10.

Temporal changes must be incorporated to the design to \naccommodate the change in perception of the child across time \n(if a child overcomes sensitivity).\nConclusions and Discussions\nDesigning for spaces in which the Autistic child could be sensorily \ncomfortable can potentially help management as many of the symptoms \ncould be manifestations of their sensory discomfort. It could possibly \nreduce parenting stress and can be empirically analyzed through \npre intervention and post intervention survey of caregiver stress. \nThe formulated matrix and design guidelines can help in designing \ncomfortable spaces at homes or at an institutional level. But at the same \ntime, the possibility of the child insisting on the same setting cannot \nbe neglected. As to the possibility of further research along this line, \nthe following may be noted. There are existing research studies that \nconclude that social deprivation influences development of skills that are \nfundamental for early speech and language development [43]. Reduced \nsocial attention will affect a child’s social experience; experience shapes \nbrain connectivity and hence the brain changes observed in older \nchildren and adults with Autism maybe a result of socially deprived \nexperience [44]. Sensory processing differences interferes with social \nparticipation [45], which hinder the ability of autistic children to \nparticipate in social interactions [46]. Hence an attempt to overcome \nthe sensory differences at an early age by desensitization/ exposure to \nspaces designed for sensory discomfort, might help reduce symptoms \nrelated to impairment in social interaction and communication in \nautistic children. There are supporting longitudinal studies proving that \nthe symptom severity in Autism decreases with age [47,48,49] which \ncould possibly be due to slow desensitization over years on exposure to \nreal world situations. And since characterization of the neurobiological \nalterations that underlie Autism and development of novel therapies \nrequire multidisciplinary collaboration [50], cross disciplinary \nresearch studies in future can explore whether specific architectural \ndesign interventions for sensory discomfort can enhance the neural \nconnectivity in cerebellar regions involved in sensory perception and \nintegration and reduce symptom severity in Autistic children.\nFunding support\nThe research work was supported by the Hay grant of Academy \nof Neuroscience for Architecture (ANFA), San Diego, CA.

Empathy involves identifying someone else’s \nmental state and having an appropriate emotional reaction to another \nperson’s thoughts and feelings. Systemizing is the drive to analyse \nor construct systems, such that when we systemize we are trying to \nidentify the rules that govern the system in order to predict how that \nsystem will behave.\nNeural theories\na. Neural connectivity abnormalities [28]\nAccording to Belmonte et.al. 2004, abnormal neural connectivity \ncould be the reason for certain motor, cognitive and social difficulties \nin Autism. Accordingly, in Autism, cerebellar activation is abnormally \nlow during a task of selective attention and abnormally high during a \nsimple motor task which correlates significantly with reduced size of \ncerebellar sub regions and resultant connectivity abnormalities.\nb. Malfunctioning based around the amygdala [30]\nSchultz, 2005 in his paper on face perception abnormalities in \nAutism integrated with fMRI literature presents a model of Autism. \nThis model argues that there is an early developmental failure in \nAutism involving the amygdala and development of certain cortical \nareas, specifically the fusiform ‘face area’ of the ventral temporal lobe. \nThe amygdala – fusiform system supports the face recognition and \nsocial cognitive skills and hence deficits in this network is the cause \nfor Autism.\nc. Mirror neuron dysfunction and salience landscape theory \nThere are certain neurons that are part of determining the intentions \nof other individuals by mentally stimulating their actions. These \nneurons called the mirror neurons, typically firing in response to seeing \nsomeone perform an action, are involved in language development and \nempathy. According to V.S.Ramachandran and L.M.Oberman, 2006 \ndysfunctional mirror neuron system could explain some of the primary \nsymptoms of Autism, including isolation and absence of empathy. \nA complimentary hypothesis, the salience landscape theory, could \naccount for secondary symptoms of Autism such as hypersensitivity, \navoidance of eye contact, etc. According to this theory, in children with \nAutism, the connections between the sensory areas and the amygdala \nmay be altered, resulting in extreme emotional responses to trivial \nsensory stimuli.\nAtypical sensory behaviors\nDeficits in the development of sensory abilities might be the original \nproblem underlying social cognition impairments in autism [15] with \nover 90% of Autistic children showing atypical sensory behaviours \n[31]. The sensory processing pattern in any child is dependent on \nthe neurological threshold and behavioral response (passive/ active \nstrategy for responding). According to Frith [32], autistic children \nhave more intense responses in sensory processing patterns and exhibit \nsensory symptoms.\nDesigning for Sensory comfort of Autistic children\nSensory subtypes and possible design interventions\nSensory subtypes of Autistic children\nAccording to Frith [32] there is a relationship between a person’s \nneurological thresholds and self-regulation strategies and that the \ninteraction of these functions creates four basic patterns of sensory \nprocessing. Neurological threshold is the point at which there is \nenough input to cause a nerve cell or a system to activate. When a \nstimulus is strong enough to trigger the threshold, it causes activation \nand we notice it [33]. Each person has a personal range of thresholds \nfor responding to sensory inputs and thresholds might be different \nfor each type of sensory input. Self-regulation corresponds to the \nbehavioural part, whether the person has a passive or active strategy \nfor responding. Passive means they let things happen around them \nand then react and active means they tend to control the amount and \ntype of input that is available to them. When these two continuously \nintersect, 4 basic patterns emerge - low registration, sensation seeking, \nsensory sensitivity and sensation avoiding (Figure 1).\nChildren with Autism have more intense sensory response patterns. \nWhen children have more intense response in low registration, this\n\nCitation: Gopal A, Raghavan J (2018) Design interventions for Sensory comfort of Autistic children.

The neural theories reviewed the theories \nof neural connectivity abnormalities [28], malfunctioning based \naround the amygdala (Schultz, 2005) and mirror neuron dysfunction \n(Ramachandran & Oberman, 2006).\nCognitive theories\nAlthough autism was first explained by Kanner in as early as 1943, \nthe nature of the core deficits underlying this disorder is still vague. \nThere are several theories and hypotheses explaining the persistent \ndeficits in Autistic children. The theories explaining Autism and \nassociated symptoms can be broadly classified into cognitive theories \nand neural theories - the former on the basis of cognitive differences \nand the latter based on neuroanatomical differences.\na. Theory of mind (Baron Cohen, Alan.M.Leslie and Uta Frith 1985)[26]\nIn 1985 ‘Cognition’ published an article by Baron Cohen, \nAlan.M.Leslie and Uta Frith entitled “does the Autistic child have a \ntheory of mind?” [28]. The theory of mind (ToM) hypothesis focussed \non explaining the poor performance of Autistic children on false belief \ntasks, where the participants were required to interpret a situation \nfrom the viewpoint of another, and suggested that the central deficit in \nAutism was the ability to ‘read’ others’ minds in social situations [14] \ncalled this ability ‘mentalizing’. The theory of mind account has been \nremarkably successful in making specific predictions about the triad of \nimpairments shown by people with Autism. However, it cannot explain \nthe non-triad features of Autism or earlier experimental evidence of \nabnormal assets and deficits on non-social tasks [28].\nb. Theory of weak central coherence (UtaFrith, 1989)[27]\nFrith’s formulation of weak coherence (originally called ‘weak \ncentral coherence’) in 1989 was built on the observations of local \nprocessing biases in Autism, combined with the relative failure to extract \nthe gist or meanings of events in everyday life. However in 2006, Happe \nand Frith reformulated the theory in 3 important ways in response to \nother empirical findings:\n(1) It is no longer regarded as a core deficit in central processing \nbut a more secondary outcome characterized by a ‘detail - focussing’ \nprocessing style,\n(2) This processing style can be overcome in certain situations, \n(3) It is one aspect of a more detailed cognitive profile which \nincludes problems with Theory of Mind [1].\nc. Theory of executive dysfunctions \nThe dominant cognitive theory of Autism is the theory of executive \ndysfunctions, executive functions being defined as the ability to \nmaintain an appropriate problem-solving set for attainment of a future \ngoal which includes behaviours such as planning, impulse control, \ninhibition of irrelevant responses, set maintenance, organized search \nand flexibility of thought and action [29]. This theory accounted for \nmany of the non-social symptoms in Autism, such as repetitive and \nobsessional behaviours.\nd. Empathizing - Systemizing theory [1]\nAccording to Baron-Cohen, 2009, the Empathizing - Systemizing \ntheory of Autism explains the social and communication difficulties \nin Autism by reference to delays and difficulties in empathy, while \nLiterature finding Inferences Inferences\nLiterature source Visual properties of built environment Positive change \ninduced Possible design guideline\nBerlyne   [10] adequate visual complexity for inducing a level of arousal.

Deficit in visual form processing [42]\nAccording to Bogdashina and O Brien, Autistic individuals have a \ndeficit in visual form processing. They used patterns of correlated dot \ntriplets where structured elements were mixed with random ones and \nfound a deficit in visual form processing in Autism [28].\nPossible design interventions (Table 5)\nObservation Studies and Survey of Caregivers - Inferences\nCase studies of ten autistic children done at homes, which included \ndetailed observation study of child as well as questionnaire survey of \ncaregivers, elicited the following inferences - Most of the autistic kids \nexhibit Insistence on Sameness (IS) and the child insisting on the same \nsetting was observed in majority of the cases. Further it was observed \nthat in the case of older kids, most of the sensory sensitivities have been \novercome and the kids have become more manageable which could \npossibly be due to slow desensitization over years on exposure to real \nworld situations.\nDesign Interventions for Sensory Comfort of Autistic \nChildren\nOverlapping the guidelines for psychological comfort, behavioral \nimpact in children, sensory comfort and visual processing differences \nin autistic children, specific guidelines were formulated for modifying \nthe design elements. The design matrix and specific guidelines for \nsensory comfort in autistic children is as follows (Figure 2).\n1. Ensure good general lighting (natural and artificial) for the \nentire space (no flickering lights or dark corners); lighting \ndesign for contrasting shadows of design elements/objects; \nensure means for unobstructed outside view with due \nconsideration to privacy.\n2. Dim indirect artificial lighting and avoid direct sunlight/glare; \nlighting design for sharp contrasting dark corners; provide \noptions to minimize outside view by providing curtains/blinds.\n3. Bright shades of contrasting warm colours are to be used in \ndesign; curve the edges of walls and surfaces; add contrasting \nvisual textures including natural looking surface finishes \n(wood/stone finish), more reflective surfaces (even mirrors), \nfractal patterns and natural elements (pebbles).\n4. Dull shades of contrasting warm colours are to be used \nin design; curve the edges of walls and surfaces; minimize \ncontrasting visual textures and reflective surfaces but include \nfractal patterns and natural elements.\n5. Echo proof through design elements (cloth curtains, \nbookcases); provide for sustained low background sound like \nwater features, wind chimes and so on.\n6. Reduce noise by acoustical treatment.\n7. Provide for prevention of heat gain in the space through \nappropriate design of transparent (double glazing for fixed \nwindows, shading for openable ones) and opaque (false ceiling \nfor heat from roofs) elements.\n8. Provide options for using temperature control systems \n(mechanical systems).\n9. Design for maximum air movement to reduce smells and \nodors.\n10. Incorporate naturally scented objects in design (like flowers, \nflowering plants or even burning incense).\n11. Cut out sources of strong smell from inside/immediate outside \nby buffers for odour abatement (indoor plants, wood).\n12. Rough surface textures and non-slippery floor surfaces.\nVisual processing difference Possible design solution\nLesser susceptibility to visual illusions\nAvoid hurdles in the expected pathway for movement of the child to minimize the trouble of figuring out the actual distance \nfrom the object Avoid drastic variations in sizes of objects adjacent to each other to minimize the trouble of figuring out spatial \nrelationships\nFailure of shape constancy Use simple geometric shapes (circle, square) to minimize visual confusion\nGestalt perception Use of predominant edges, use of texture gradient, colour and lighting contrast as cues for figure-ground discrimination\nDeficit in visual form processing Avoid overlap of objects in major view points as these might be perceived not as the simplest form and might cause visual \noverload\nTable 5: The visual processing differences and the possible design solutions.\nFigure 2:  Sensory comfort in Autistic children.', name='retrieve_docs', id='cdeac717-f120-449d-9293-868c72d11097', tool_call_id='call_iXjbUPtZKNNoInuCQxU1xDaq')]}

Temporal changes must be incorporated to the design to \naccommodate the change in perception of the child across time \n(if a child overcomes sensitivity).\nConclusions and Discussions\nDesigning for spaces in which the Autistic child could be sensorily \ncomfortable can potentially help management as many of the symptoms \ncould be manifestations of their sensory discomfort. It could possibly \nreduce parenting stress and can be empirically analyzed through \npre intervention and post intervention survey of caregiver stress. \nThe formulated matrix and design guidelines can help in designing \ncomfortable spaces at homes or at an institutional level. But at the same \ntime, the possibility of the child insisting on the same setting cannot \nbe neglected. As to the possibility of further research along this line, \nthe following may be noted. There are existing research studies that \nconclude that social deprivation influences development of skills that are \nfundamental for early speech and language development [43]. Reduced \nsocial attention will affect a child’s social experience; experience shapes \nbrain connectivity and hence the brain changes observed in older \nchildren and adults with Autism maybe a result of socially deprived \nexperience [44]. Sensory processing differences interferes with social \nparticipation [45], which hinder the ability of autistic children to \nparticipate in social interactions [46]. Hence an attempt to overcome \nthe sensory differences at an early age by desensitization/ exposure to \nspaces designed for sensory discomfort, might help reduce symptoms \nrelated to impairment in social interaction and communication in \nautistic children. There are supporting longitudinal studies proving that \nthe symptom severity in Autism decreases with age [47,48,49] which \ncould possibly be due to slow desensitization over years on exposure to \nreal world situations. And since characterization of the neurobiological \nalterations that underlie Autism and development of novel therapies \nrequire multidisciplinary collaboration [50], cross disciplinary \nresearch studies in future can explore whether specific architectural \ndesign interventions for sensory discomfort can enhance the neural \nconnectivity in cerebellar regions involved in sensory perception and \nintegration and reduce symptom severity in Autistic children.\nFunding support\nThe research work was supported by the Hay grant of Academy \nof Neuroscience for Architecture (ANFA), San Diego, CA.

Accordingly, in Autism, cerebellar activation is abnormally \nlow during a task of selective attention and abnormally high during a \nsimple motor task which correlates significantly with reduced size of \ncerebellar sub regions and resultant connectivity abnormalities.\nb. Malfunctioning based around the amygdala [30]\nSchultz, 2005 in his paper on face perception abnormalities in \nAutism integrated with fMRI literature presents a model of Autism. \nThis model argues that there is an early developmental failure in \nAutism involving the amygdala and development of certain cortical \nareas, specifically the fusiform ‘face area’ of the ventral temporal lobe. \nThe amygdala – fusiform system supports the face recognition and \nsocial cognitive skills and hence deficits in this network is the cause \nfor Autism.\nc. Mirror neuron dysfunction and salience landscape theory \nThere are certain neurons that are part of determining the intentions \nof other individuals by mentally stimulating their actions. These \nneurons called the mirror neurons, typically firing in response to seeing \nsomeone perform an action, are involved in language development and \nempathy. According to V.S.Ramachandran and L.M.Oberman, 2006 \ndysfunctional mirror neuron system could explain some of the primary \nsymptoms of Autism, including isolation and absence of empathy. \nA complimentary hypothesis, the salience landscape theory, could \naccount for secondary symptoms of Autism such as hypersensitivity, \navoidance of eye contact, etc. According to this theory, in children with \nAutism, the connections between the sensory areas and the amygdala \nmay be altered, resulting in extreme emotional responses to trivial \nsensory stimuli.\nAtypical sensory behaviors\nDeficits in the development of sensory abilities might be the original \nproblem underlying social cognition impairments in autism [15] with \nover 90% of Autistic children showing atypical sensory behaviours \n[31]. The sensory processing pattern in any child is dependent on \nthe neurological threshold and behavioral response (passive/ active \nstrategy for responding). According to Frith [32], autistic children \nhave more intense responses in sensory processing patterns and exhibit \nsensory symptoms.\nDesigning for Sensory comfort of Autistic children\nSensory subtypes and possible design interventions\nSensory subtypes of Autistic children\nAccording to Frith [32] there is a relationship between a person’s \nneurological thresholds and self-regulation strategies and that the \ninteraction of these functions creates four basic patterns of sensory \nprocessing. Neurological threshold is the point at which there is \nenough input to cause a nerve cell or a system to activate. When a \nstimulus is strong enough to trigger the threshold, it causes activation \nand we notice it [33]. Each person has a personal range of thresholds \nfor responding to sensory inputs and thresholds might be different \nfor each type of sensory input. Self-regulation corresponds to the \nbehavioural part, whether the person has a passive or active strategy \nfor responding. Passive means they let things happen around them \nand then react and active means they tend to control the amount and \ntype of input that is available to them. When these two continuously \nintersect, 4 basic patterns emerge - low registration, sensation seeking, \nsensory sensitivity and sensation avoiding (Figure 1).\nChildren with Autism have more intense sensory response patterns. \nWhen children have more intense response in low registration, this\n\nCitation: Gopal A, Raghavan J (2018) Design interventions for Sensory comfort of Autistic children.

The neural theories reviewed the theories \nof neural connectivity abnormalities [28], malfunctioning based \naround the amygdala (Schultz, 2005) and mirror neuron dysfunction \n(Ramachandran & Oberman, 2006).\nCognitive theories\nAlthough autism was first explained by Kanner in as early as 1943, \nthe nature of the core deficits underlying this disorder is still vague. \nThere are several theories and hypotheses explaining the persistent \ndeficits in Autistic children. The theories explaining Autism and \nassociated symptoms can be broadly classified into cognitive theories \nand neural theories - the former on the basis of cognitive differences \nand the latter based on neuroanatomical differences.\na. Theory of mind (Baron Cohen, Alan.M.Leslie and Uta Frith 1985)[26]\nIn 1985 ‘Cognition’ published an article by Baron Cohen, \nAlan.M.Leslie and Uta Frith entitled “does the Autistic child have a \ntheory of mind?” [28]. The theory of mind (ToM) hypothesis focussed \non explaining the poor performance of Autistic children on false belief \ntasks, where the participants were required to interpret a situation \nfrom the viewpoint of another, and suggested that the central deficit in \nAutism was the ability to ‘read’ others’ minds in social situations [14] \ncalled this ability ‘mentalizing’. The theory of mind account has been \nremarkably successful in making specific predictions about the triad of \nimpairments shown by people with Autism. However, it cannot explain \nthe non-triad features of Autism or earlier experimental evidence of \nabnormal assets and deficits on non-social tasks [28].\nb. Theory of weak central coherence (UtaFrith, 1989)[27]\nFrith’s formulation of weak coherence (originally called ‘weak \ncentral coherence’) in 1989 was built on the observations of local \nprocessing biases in Autism, combined with the relative failure to extract \nthe gist or meanings of events in everyday life. However in 2006, Happe \nand Frith reformulated the theory in 3 important ways in response to \nother empirical findings:\n(1) It is no longer regarded as a core deficit in central processing \nbut a more secondary outcome characterized by a ‘detail - focussing’ \nprocessing style,\n(2) This processing style can be overcome in certain situations, \n(3) It is one aspect of a more detailed cognitive profile which \nincludes problems with Theory of Mind [1].\nc. Theory of executive dysfunctions \nThe dominant cognitive theory of Autism is the theory of executive \ndysfunctions, executive functions being defined as the ability to \nmaintain an appropriate problem-solving set for attainment of a future \ngoal which includes behaviours such as planning, impulse control, \ninhibition of irrelevant responses, set maintenance, organized search \nand flexibility of thought and action [29]. This theory accounted for \nmany of the non-social symptoms in Autism, such as repetitive and \nobsessional behaviours.\nd. Empathizing - Systemizing theory [1]\nAccording to Baron-Cohen, 2009, the Empathizing - Systemizing \ntheory of Autism explains the social and communication difficulties \nin Autism by reference to delays and difficulties in empathy, while \nLiterature finding Inferences Inferences\nLiterature source Visual properties of built environment Positive change \ninduced Possible design guideline\nBerlyne   [10] adequate visual complexity for inducing a level of arousal.

Deficit in visual form processing [42]\nAccording to Bogdashina and O Brien, Autistic individuals have a \ndeficit in visual form processing. They used patterns of correlated dot \ntriplets where structured elements were mixed with random ones and \nfound a deficit in visual form processing in Autism [28].\nPossible design interventions (Table 5)\nObservation Studies and Survey of Caregivers - Inferences\nCase studies of ten autistic children done at homes, which included \ndetailed observation study of child as well as questionnaire survey of \ncaregivers, elicited the following inferences - Most of the autistic kids \nexhibit Insistence on Sameness (IS) and the child insisting on the same \nsetting was observed in majority of the cases. Further it was observed \nthat in the case of older kids, most of the sensory sensitivities have been \novercome and the kids have become more manageable which could \npossibly be due to slow desensitization over years on exposure to real \nworld situations.\nDesign Interventions for Sensory Comfort of Autistic \nChildren\nOverlapping the guidelines for psychological comfort, behavioral \nimpact in children, sensory comfort and visual processing differences \nin autistic children, specific guidelines were formulated for modifying \nthe design elements. The design matrix and specific guidelines for \nsensory comfort in autistic children is as follows (Figure 2).\n1. Ensure good general lighting (natural and artificial) for the \nentire space (no flickering lights or dark corners); lighting \ndesign for contrasting shadows of design elements/objects; \nensure means for unobstructed outside view with due \nconsideration to privacy.\n2. Dim indirect artificial lighting and avoid direct sunlight/glare; \nlighting design for sharp contrasting dark corners; provide \noptions to minimize outside view by providing curtains/blinds.\n3. Bright shades of contrasting warm colours are to be used in \ndesign; curve the edges of walls and surfaces; add contrasting \nvisual textures including natural looking surface finishes \n(wood/stone finish), more reflective surfaces (even mirrors), \nfractal patterns and natural elements (pebbles).\n4. Dull shades of contrasting warm colours are to be used \nin design; curve the edges of walls and surfaces; minimize \ncontrasting visual textures and reflective surfaces but include \nfractal patterns and natural elements.\n5. Echo proof through design elements (cloth curtains, \nbookcases); provide for sustained low background sound like \nwater features, wind chimes and so on.\n6. Reduce noise by acoustical treatment.\n7. Provide for prevention of heat gain in the space through \nappropriate design of transparent (double glazing for fixed \nwindows, shading for openable ones) and opaque (false ceiling \nfor heat from roofs) elements.\n8. Provide options for using temperature control systems \n(mechanical systems).\n9. Design for maximum air movement to reduce smells and \nodors.\n10. Incorporate naturally scented objects in design (like flowers, \nflowering plants or even burning incense).\n11. Cut out sources of strong smell from inside/immediate outside \nby buffers for odour abatement (indoor plants, wood).\n12. Rough surface textures and non-slippery floor surfaces.\nVisual processing difference Possible design solution\nLesser susceptibility to visual illusions\nAvoid hurdles in the expected pathway for movement of the child to minimize the trouble of figuring out the actual distance \nfrom the object Avoid drastic variations in sizes of objects adjacent to each other to minimize the trouble of figuring out spatial \nrelationships\nFailure of shape constancy Use simple geometric shapes (circle, square) to minimize visual confusion\nGestalt perception Use of predominant edges, use of texture gradient, colour and lighting contrast as cues for figure-ground discrimination\nDeficit in visual form processing Avoid overlap of objects in major view points as these might be perceived not as the simplest form and might cause visual \noverload\nTable 5: The visual processing differences and the possible design solutions.\nFigure 2:  Sensory comfort in Autistic children.', name='retrieve_docs', id='d79970ea-be46-4580-ac0d-f82246e23f7c', tool_call_id='call_sG2WHSHuRQ7wd3VwgfXOZqoA')]}
